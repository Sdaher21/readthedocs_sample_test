<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ONAP project addresses the rising need for a common automation platform for
telecommunication, cable, and cloud service providersâ€”and their solution
providersâ€”to deliver differentiated network services on demand, profitably and
competitively, while leveraging existing investments.</p>
<p>The challenge that ONAP meets is to help operators of telecommunication
networks to keep up with the scale and cost of manual changes required to
implement new service offerings, from installing new data center equipment to,
in some cases, upgrading on-premises customer equipment. Many are seeking to
exploit SDN and NFV to improve service velocity, simplify equipment
interoperability and integration, and to reduce overall CapEx and OpEx costs.
In addition, the current, highly fragmented management landscape makes it
difficult to monitor and guarantee service-level agreements (SLAs). These
challenges are still very real now as ONAP creates its fourth release.</p>
<p>ONAP is addressing these challenges by developing global and massive scale
(multi-site and multi-VIM) automation capabilities for both physical and
virtual network elements. It facilitates service agility by supporting data
models for rapid service and resource deployment and providing a common set of
northbound REST APIs that are open and interoperable, and by supporting
model-driven interfaces to the networks. ONAPâ€™s modular and layered nature
improves interoperability and simplifies integration, allowing it to support
multiple VNF environments by integrating with multiple VIMs, VNFMs,
SDN Controllers, as well as legacy equipment (PNF). ONAPâ€™s consolidated xNF
requirements publication enables commercial development of ONAP-compliant xNFs.
This approach allows network and cloud operators to optimize their physical
and virtual infrastructure for cost and performance; at the same time, ONAPâ€™s
use of standard models reduces integration and deployment costs of
heterogeneous equipment. All this is achieved while minimizing management
fragmentation.</p>
<p>The ONAP platform allows end-user organizations and their network/cloud
providers to collaboratively instantiate network elements and services in a
rapid and dynamic way, together with supporting a closed control loop process
that supports real-time response to actionable events. In order to design,
engineer, plan, bill and assure these dynamic services, there are three major
requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A robust design framework that allows the specification of the service in
all aspects â€“ modeling the resources and relationships that make up the
service, specifying the policy rules that guide the service behavior,
specifying the applications, analytics and closed control loop events needed
for the elastic management of the service</p></li>
<li><p>An orchestration and control framework (Service Orchestrator and Controllers
) that is recipe/ policy-driven to provide an automated instantiation of the
service when needed and managing service demands in an elastic manner</p></li>
<li><p>An analytic framework that closely monitors the service behavior during the
service lifecycle based on the specified design, analytics and policies to
enable response as required from the control framework, to deal with
situations ranging from those that require healing to those that require
scaling of the resources to elastically adjust to demand variations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this, ONAP decouples the details of specific services and supporting
technologies from the common information models, core orchestration platform,
and generic management engines (for discovery, provisioning, assurance etc.).
Furthermore, it marries the speed and style of a DevOps/NetOps approach with
the formal models and processes operators require to introduce new services
and technologies. It leverages cloud-native technologies including Kubernetes
to manage and rapidly deploy the ONAP platform and related components. This is
in stark contrast to traditional OSS/Management software platform
architectures, which hardcoded services and technologies, and required lengthy
software development and integration cycles to incorporate changes.</p>
<p>The ONAP Platform enables service/resource independent capabilities for design,
creation and lifecycle management, in accordance with the following
foundational principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ability to dynamically introduce full service lifecycle orchestration (design
,provisioning and operation) and service API for new services and
technologies without the need for new platform software releases or without
affecting operations for the existing services</p></li>
<li><p>Carrier-grade scalability including horizontal scaling (linear scale-out) and
distribution to support a large number of services and large networks</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata-driven and policy-driven architecture to ensure flexible and
automated ways in which capabilities are used and delivered</p></li>
<li><p>The architecture shall enable sourcing best-in-class components</p></li>
<li><p>Common capabilities are â€˜developedâ€™ once and â€˜usedâ€™ many times</p></li>
<li><p>Core capabilities shall support many diverse services and infrastructures</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further, ONAP comes with a functional architecture with component definitions
and interfaces, which provides a force of industry alignment in addition to
the open source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>ONAP Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ONAP architecture consists of a design time and run time functions, as well
as functions for managing ONAP itself.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1 provides a high-level view of the ONAP architecture with its
microservices-based platform components.</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="images/ONAP-architecture.png"><img alt="image1" src="images/ONAP-architecture.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a></p>
<p>Figure 2 below, provides a simplified functional view of the architecture,
which highlights the role of a few key components:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Design time environment for onboarding services and resources into ONAP and
designing required services.</p></li>
<li><p>External API provides northbound interoperability for the ONAP Platform and
Multi-VIM/Cloud provides cloud interoperability for the ONAP workloads.</p></li>
<li><p>OOM provides the ability to manage cloud-native installation and
deployments to Kubernetes-managed cloud environments.</p></li>
<li><p>ONAP Shared Services provides shared capabilities for ONAP modules. MUSIC
allows ONAP to scale to multi-site environments to support global scale
infrastructure requirements. The ONAP Optimization Framework (OOF) provides
a declarative, policy-driven approach for creating and running optimization
applications like Homing/Placement, and Change Management Scheduling
Optimization. Logging provides centralized logging capabilities, Audit
(POMBA) provides capabilities to understand orchestration actions.</p></li>
<li><p>ONAP shared utilities provide utilities for the support of the ONAP
components.</p></li>
<li><p>Information Model and framework utilities continue to evolve to harmonize
the topology, workflow, and policy models from a number of SDOs including
ETSI NFV MANO, TM Forum SID, ONF Core, OASIS TOSCA, IETF, and MEF.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="microservices-support">
<h2>Microservices Support<a class="headerlink" href="#microservices-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a cloud-native application that consists of numerous services, ONAP requires
sophisticated initial deployment as well as post- deployment management.</p>
<p>The ONAP deployment methodology needs to be flexible enough to suit the
different scenarios and purposes for various operator environments. Users may
also want to select a portion of the ONAP components to integrate into their
own systems. And the platform needs to be highly reliable, scalable, secure and
easy to manage. To achieve all these goals, ONAP is designed as a
microservices-based system, with all components released as Docker containers
following best practice building rules to optimize their image size. To reduce
the ONAP footprint, a first effort to use shared data base have been initiated
with a Cassandra and mariadb-galera clusters.</p>
<p>The ONAP Operations Manager (OOM) is responsible for orchestrating the
end-to-end lifecycle management and monitoring of ONAP components. OOM uses
Kubernetes to provide CPU efficiency and platform deployment. In addition, OOM
helps enhance ONAP platform maturity by providing scalability and resiliency
enhancements to the components it manages.</p>
<p>OOM is the lifecycle manager of the ONAP platform and uses the Kubernetes
container management system and Consul to provide the following functionality:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Deployment - with built-in component dependency management (including
multiple clusters, federated deployments across sites, and anti-affinity
rules)</p></li>
<li><p>Configuration - unified configuration across all ONAP components</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring - real-time health monitoring feeding to a Consul GUI and
Kubernetes</p></li>
<li><p>Restart - failed ONAP components are restarted automatically</p></li>
<li><p>Clustering and Scaling - cluster ONAP services to enable seamless scaling</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade - change out containers or configuration with little or no service
impact</p></li>
<li><p>Deletion - clean up individual containers or entire deployments</p></li>
</ol>
<p>OOM supports a wide variety of cloud infrastructures to suit your individual
requirements.</p>
<p>Microservices Bus (MSB) provides fundamental microservices supports including
service registration/ discovery, external API gateway, internal API gateway,
client software development kit (SDK), and Swagger SDK. When integrating with
OOM, MSB has a Kube2MSB registrar which can grasp services information from k8s
metafile and automatically register the services for ONAP components.</p>
<p>In the spirit of leveraging the microservice capabilities, further steps
towards increased modularity have been taken. Service
Orchestrator (SO) and the controllers have increased its level of modularity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="portal">
<h2>Portal<a class="headerlink" href="#portal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ONAP delivers a single, consistent user experience to both design time and
runtime environments, based on the userâ€™s role. Role changes are configured
within a single ONAP instance.</p>
<p>This user experience is managed by the ONAP Portal, which provides access to
design, analytics and operational control/administration functions via a
shared, role-based menu or dashboard. The portal architecture provides
web-based capabilities such as application onboarding and management,
centralized access management through the Authentication and Authorization
Framework (AAF), and dashboards, as well as hosted application widgets.</p>
<p>The portal provides an SDK to enable multiple development teams to adhere to
consistent UI development requirements by taking advantage of built-in
capabilities (Services/ API/ UI controls), tools and technologies. ONAP also
provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for operators who require it (e.g., to
integrate with their scripting environment). ONAP SDKs enable
operations/security, third parties (e.g., vendors and consultants), and other
experts to continually define/redefine new collection, analytics, and policies
(including recipes for corrective/remedial action) using the ONAP Design
Framework Portal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-time-framework">
<h2>Design Time Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#design-time-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The design time framework is a comprehensive development environment with
tools, techniques, and repositories for defining/ describing resources,
services, and products.</p>
<p>The design time framework facilitates reuse of models, further improving
efficiency as more and more models become available. Resources, services,
products, and their management and control functions can all be modeled using
a common set of specifications and policies (e.g., rule sets) for controlling
behavior and process execution. Process specifications automatically sequence
instantiation, delivery and lifecycle management for resources, services,
products and the ONAP platform components themselves. Certain process
specifications (i.e., â€˜recipesâ€™) and policies are geographically distributed
to optimize performance and maximize autonomous behavior in federated cloud
environments.</p>
<p>Service Design and Creation (SDC) provides tools, techniques, and repositories
to define/simulate/certify system assets as well as their associated processes
and policies. Each asset is categorized into one of four asset groups:
Resource, Services, Products, or Offers. SDC also supports TOSCA1.3 List type
definition which provides the ability to design complicated
service descriptor.</p>
<p>The SDC environment supports diverse users via common services and utilities.
Using the design studio, product and service designers onboard/extend/retire
resources, services and products. Operations, Engineers, Customer Experience
Managers, and Security Experts create workflows, policies and methods to
implement Closed control Loop Automation/Control and manage elastic
scalability.</p>
<p>To support and encourage a healthy VNF ecosystem, ONAP provides a set of VNF
packaging and validation tools in the VNF Supplier API and Software Development
Kit (VNF SDK) and VNF Validation Program (VVP) components. Vendors can
integrate these tools in their CI/CD environments to package VNFs and upload
them to the validation engine. Once tested, the VNFs can be onboarded through
SDC. In addition, the testing capability of VNFSDK is being utilized at the
LFN Compliance Verification Program to work towards ensuring a highly
consistent approach to VNF verification.</p>
<p>The Policy Creation component deals with policies; these are rules, conditions,
requirements, constraints, attributes, or needs that must be provided,
maintained, and/or enforced. At a lower level, Policy involves machine-readable
rules enabling actions to be taken based on triggers or requests. Policies
often consider specific conditions in effect (both in terms of triggering
specific policies when conditions are met, and in selecting specific outcomes
of the evaluated policies appropriate to the conditions).</p>
<p>Policy allows rapid modification through easily updating rules, thus updating
technical behaviors of components in which those policies are used, without
requiring rewrites of their software code. Policy permits simpler management
/ control of complex mechanisms via abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="runtime-framework">
<h2>Runtime Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The runtime execution framework executes the rules and policies and other
models distributed by the design and creation environment.</p>
<p>This allows for the distribution of models and policy among
various ONAP modules such as the Service Orchestrator (SO), Controllers,
Data Collection, Analytics and Events (DCAE), Active and Available Inventory
(A&amp;AI). These components use common services that
support logging, access control, Multi-Site State Coordination (MUSIC), which
allow the platform to register and manage state across multi-site deployments.</p>
<div class="section" id="orchestration">
<h3>Orchestration<a class="headerlink" href="#orchestration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Service Orchestrator (SO) component executes the specified processes by
automating sequences of activities, tasks, rules and policies needed for
on-demand creation, modification or removal of network, application or
infrastructure services and resources, this includes VNFs, CNFs and PNFs.
The SO provides orchestration at a very high level, with an end-to-end view of
the infrastructure, network, and applications.</p>
<p>One is BroadBand Service (BBS), the second one is Cross Domain and Cross Layer
VPN (CCVPN).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtual-infrastructure-deployment-vid">
<h3>Virtual Infrastructure Deployment (VID)<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-infrastructure-deployment-vid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Virtual Infrastructure Deployment (VID) application enables users to
instantiate infrastructure services from SDC, along with their associated
components, and to execute change management operations such as scaling and
software upgrades to existing VNF instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="policy-driven-workload-optimization">
<h3>Policy-Driven Workload Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#policy-driven-workload-optimization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ONAP Optimization Framework (OOF) provides a policy-driven and model-driven
framework for creating optimization applications for a broad range of use
cases. OOF Homing and Allocation Service (HAS) is a policy driven workload
optimization service that enables optimized placement of services across
multiple sites and multiple clouds, based on a wide variety of policy
constraints including capacity, location, platform capabilities, and other
service specific constraints.</p>
<p>ONAP Multi-VIM/Cloud (MC) and several other ONAP components such as Policy, SO,
A&amp;AI etc. play an important role in enabling â€œPolicy-driven
Performance/Security-Aware Adaptive Workload Placement/ Schedulingâ€ across
cloud sites through OOF-HAS. OOF-HAS uses Hardware Platform Awareness (HPA),
cloud agnostic Intent capabilities, and real-time capacity checks provided by
ONAP MC to determine the optimal VIM/Cloud instances, which can deliver the
required performance SLAs, for workload (VNF etc.) placement and scheduling
(Homing). Operators now realize the true value of virtualization through fine
grained optimization of cloud resources while delivering performance and
security SLAs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="controllers">
<h3>Controllers<a class="headerlink" href="#controllers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Controllers are applications which are coupled with cloud and network services
and execute the configuration, real-time policies, and control the state of
distributed components and services. Rather than using a single monolithic
control layer, operators may choose to use multiple distinct controller types
that manage resources in the execution environment corresponding to their
assigned controlled domain such as cloud computing resources (network
configuration (SDN-C) and application (App-C). The App-C and SDN-C also support
the Virtual Function Controller (VF-C) provides an ETSI NFV compliant NFV-O
function that is responsible for lifecycle management of virtual services and
the associated physical COTS server infrastructure. VF-C provides a generic
VNFM capability but also integrates with external VNFMs and VIMs as part of an
NFV MANO stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inventory">
<h3>Inventory<a class="headerlink" href="#inventory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Active and Available Inventory (A&amp;AI) provides real-time views of a systemâ€™s
resources, services, products and their relationships with each other, and also
retains a historical view. The views provided by A&amp;AI relate data managed by
multiple ONAP instances, Business Support Systems (BSS), Operation Support
Systems (OSS), and network applications to form a â€œtop to bottomâ€ view ranging
from the products end users buy, to the resources that form the raw material
for creating the products. A&amp;AI not only forms a registry of products,
services, and resources, it also maintains up-to-date views of the
relationships between these inventory items.</p>
<p>To deliver the promised dynamism of SDN/NFV, A&amp;AI is updated in real time by
the controllers as they make changes in the network environment. A&amp;AI is
metadata-driven, allowing new inventory types to be added dynamically and
quickly via SDC catalog definitions, eliminating the need for lengthy
development cycles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="policy-framework">
<h3>Policy Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#policy-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Policy framework provides policy based decision making capability and
supports multiple policy engines and can distribute policies through policy
design capabilities in SDC, simplifying the design process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-cloud-adaptation">
<h3>Multi Cloud Adaptation<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-cloud-adaptation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Multi-VIM/Cloud provides and infrastructure adaptation layer for VIMs/Clouds
in exposing advanced hardware platform awareness and cloud agnostic intent
capabilities, besides standard capabilities, which are used by OOF and other
components for enhanced cloud selection and SO/VF-C for cloud agnostic workload
deployment.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="closed-control-loop-automation">
<h2>Closed Control Loop Automation<a class="headerlink" href="#closed-control-loop-automation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Closed loop control is provided by cooperation among a number of design-time
and run-time elements. The Runtime loop starts with data collectors from Data
Collection, Analytics and Events (DCAE). ONAP includes the following
collectors: VES for events, HV-VES for high-volume events, SNMP for SNMP traps,
File Collector to receive files, and Restconf Collector to collect the
notifications. After data collection/verification phase, data are moved through
the loop of micro-services like Homes for event detection, Policy for
determining actions, and finally, controllers and orchestrators to implement
actions CLAMP is used to monitor the loops themselves. DCAE also supports
(Platform for Network Data Analytics) PNDA analytics capabilities.  CLAMP,
Policy and DCAE all have design time aspects to support the creation of the
loops.</p>
<p>We refer to this automation pattern as â€œclosed control loop automationâ€ in that
it provides the necessary automation to proactively respond to network and
service conditions without human intervention. A high-level schematic of the
â€œclosed control loop automationâ€ and the various phases within the service
lifecycle using the automation is depicted in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Closed control loop control is provided by Data Collection, Analytics and
Events (DCAE) and one or more of the other ONAP runtime components.
Collectively, they provide FCAPS (Fault Configuration Accounting Performance
Security) functionality. DCAE collects performance, usage, and configuration
data; provides computation of analytics; aids in troubleshooting; and publishes
events, data and analytics (e.g., to policy, orchestration, and the data lake).
Another component, â€œHolmesâ€, connects to DCAE and provides alarm correlation
for ONAP, new data collection capabilities with High Volume VES, and bulk
performance management support.</p>
<p>Working with the Policy Framework and CLAMP, these components detect problems
in the network and identify the appropriate remediation. In some cases, the
action will be automatic, and they will notify Service Orchestrator or one of
the controllers to take action. In other cases, as configured by the operator,
they will raise an alarm but require human intervention before executing the
change. The policy framework is extended to support additional policy decision
capabilities with the introduction of adaptive policy execution.</p>

<h2>ONAP Blueprints<a class="headerlink" href="#onap-blueprints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ONAP can support an unlimited number of use cases, within reason. However, to
provide concrete examples of how to use ONAP to solve real-world problems, the
community has created a set of blueprints. In addition to helping users
rapidly adopt the ONAP platform through end-to-end solutions, these blueprints
also help the community prioritize their work. With the ONAP Frankfurt release,
we introduced a new blueprint in the area of optical transport networking
called Multi-Domain Optical Network Service (MDONS). Prior blueprints were
vCPE, VoLTE, vFW/vDNS, 5G, and CCVPN. 5G and CCVPN underwent feature
enhancements during the Frankfurt release.</p>
<div class="section" id="g-blueprint">
<h3>5G Blueprint<a class="headerlink" href="#g-blueprint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The 5G blueprint is a multi-release effort, with five key initiatives around
end-to-end service orchestration, network slicing, PNF/VNF lifecycle management
, PNF integration, and network optimization. The combination of eMBB that
promises peak data rates of 20 Mbps, uRLLC that guarantees sub-millisecond
response times, MMTC that can support 0.92 devices per sq. ft., and network
slicing brings with it some unique requirements. First ONAP needs to manage the
lifecycle of a network slice from initial creation/activation all the way to
deactivation/termination. Next, ONAP needs to optimize the network around real
time and bulk analytics, place VNFs on the correct edge cloud, scale and heal
services, and provide edge automation. ONAP also provides self organizing
network (SON) services such as physical cell ID allocation for new RAN sites.
These requirements have led to the five above-listed initiatives and have been
developed in close cooperation with other standards and open source
organizations such as 3GPP, TM Forum, ETSI, and O-RAN Software Community.</p>

<h4>Virtual CPE (vCPE)<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-cpe-vcpe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Currently, services offered to a subscriber are restricted to what is
designed into the broadband residential gateway. In the blueprint, the customer
has a slimmed down physical CPE (pCPE) attached to a traditional broadband
network such as DSL, DOCSIS, or PON (Figure 5). A tunnel is established to a
data center hosting various VNFs providing a much larger set of services to the
subscriber at a significantly lower cost to the operator. In this blueprint,
ONAP supports complex orchestration and management of open source VNFs and both
virtual and underlay connectivity.</p>

ONAP for the design, deployment, lifecycle management, and service assurance of
broadband services.  It further shows how ONAP can orchestrate services across
different locations (e.g. Central Office, Core) and technology domains (e.g.
Access, Edge).</p>

<h3>Voice over LTE (VoLTE) Blueprint<a class="headerlink" href="#voice-over-lte-volte-blueprint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This blueprint uses ONAP to orchestrate a Voice over LTE service. The VoLTE
blueprint incorporates commercial VNFs to create and manage the underlying vEPC
and vIMS services by interworking with vendor-specific components, including
VNFMs, EMSs, VIMs and SDN controllers, across Edge Data Centers and a Core Data
Center. ONAP supports the VoLTE use case with several key components: SO, VF-C,
SDN-C, and Multi-VIM/ Cloud. In this blueprint, SO is responsible for VoLTE
end-to-end service orchestration working in collaboration with VF-C and SDN-C.
SDN-C establishes network connectivity, then the VF-C component completes the
Network Services and VNF lifecycle management (including service initiation,
termination and manual scaling) and FCAPS (fault, configuration, accounting,
performance, security) management. This blueprint also shows advanced
functionality such as scaling and change management.</p>

<h3>CCVPN (Cross Domain and Cross Layer VPN) Blueprint<a class="headerlink" href="#ccvpn-cross-domain-and-cross-layer-vpn-blueprint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CSPs, such as CMCC and Vodafone, see a strong demand for high-bandwidth, flat,
high-speed OTN (Optical Transport Networks) across carrier networks. They also
want to provide a high-speed, flexible and intelligent service for high-value
customers, and an instant and flexible VPN service for SMB companies.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="images/ONAP-ccvpn.png"><img alt="image8" src="images/ONAP-ccvpn.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Figure 8. ONAP CCVPN Architecture</strong></p>
<p>The CCVPN (Cross Domain and Cross Layer VPN) blueprint is a combination of SOTN
(Super high-speed Optical Transport Network) and ONAP, which takes advantage of
the orchestration ability of ONAP, to realize a unified management and
scheduling of resources and services. It achieves cross-domain orchestration
and ONAP peering across service providers. In this blueprint, SO is responsible
for CCVPN end-to-end service orchestration working in collaboration with VF-C
and SDN-C. SDN-C establishes network connectivity, then the VF-C component
completes the Network Services and VNF lifecycle management. ONAP peering
across CSPs uses an east-west API which is being aligned with the MEF Interlude
API. The key innovations in this use case are physical network discovery and
modeling, cross-domain orchestration across multiple physical networks, cross
operator end-to-end service provisioning, close-loop reroute for
cross-domain service, dynamic changes (branch sites, VNFs) and intelligent
service optimization (including AI/ML). The Frankfurt release adds support for
end-to-end E-LINE services over optical transport network (OTN)
network-to-network interface (NNI).</p>

<h3>MDONS (Multi-Domain Optical Network Service) Blueprint<a class="headerlink" href="#mdons-multi-domain-optical-network-service-blueprint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While CCVPN addresses the automation of networking layers 2 and 3, it does not
address layers 0 and 1. Automating these layers is equally important because
providing an end-to-end service to their customers often requires a manual and
complex negotiation between CSPs that includes both the business arrangement
and the actual service design and activation. CSPs may also be structured such
that they operate multiple networks independently and require similar
transactions among their own networks and business units in order to provide an
end-to-end service. The MDONS blueprint created by AT&amp;T, Orange, and Fujitsu
solves the above problem. MDONS and CCVPN used together can solve the OTN
automation problem in a comprehensive manner.</p>
